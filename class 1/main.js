console.log('Hello world');
console.log(a);// javascript can partially run the code unlike other compiled languages like c, java, etc. javascript is a interpreted language that means it does not require to convert the whole code into a temp file like conversion of whole code into 0 and 1. even though code get converted into 0's and 1's in javscript too, but it goes line by line means it first executes first line of code then second and so on, so thats why if you have 5 lines of code and you have an error on the 4th line it would first execute and the first three lines and then give error on the 4 th line.
