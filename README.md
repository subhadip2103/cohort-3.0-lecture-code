# ðŸ“˜ Cohort 3.0 â€“ Lecture Practice Code

This repository contains all the code I wrote while self-learning from the recorded lectures of **Harkirat Singh's Cohort 3.0**.

I didnâ€™t attend the live Cohort 3.0 classes, but I followed the same structured curriculum through the recordings â€” day-by-day â€” writing every line of code myself, from setting up local servers to simulating React with vanilla JS.
